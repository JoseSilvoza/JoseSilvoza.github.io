Jose Silvoza Portfolio

A short insight from a months work into starting a new path towards coding.
Determined to take my talents to new heights and elevating my career opportunities.
I am content with what I published considering I would have never thought I would be capable of doing such a thing like creating a website.
Nevertheless, I also am capable of expanding my knowledge and looking forward to my next impossible task. 
This is just the first stepping stone of many more to come and am eager to develop new skills
