  <h1>Introductions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I am currently 23 years old, Filipino born and raised in the city of Stamford, Connecticut. Being the oldest in my family, I am also first generation student with four younger sisters.</li>
    <li>I have recently relocated out of Stamford into warmer climates, now residing in Tempe, Arizona.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been a team player, with a student-teacher mentalitiy I am able to use my abilities to my advantage and learn from my mistakes. I firmly believe in trusting the process and being able to maintain a positive mentality through uphill battles and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
    <p>Growing up as an inner-city kid and going to very diverse schools, we were always considered the Underdogs. One thing I realized throughout my time in public schools that stuck with me to this day is, "hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard." That translated onto the lacrosse field affecting each one on the team, bringing us to the only time our school won City Champs and qualified for States. It also showed me through commitment and consistency goes a very long way.</p>
