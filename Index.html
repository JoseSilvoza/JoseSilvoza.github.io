  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been a team player, with a student-teacher mentalitiy I am able to use my abilities to my advantage and learn from my mistakes. I firmly believe in trusting the process and being able to maintain a positive mentality through uphill battles and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
    <p>Growing up as an inner-city kid and going to very diverse schools, we were always considered the Underdogs. One thing I realized throughout my time in public schools that stuck with me to this day is, "hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard." Being a student-athlete that not only inspired me in the classroom but it also translated onto the lacrosse field affecting everyone on the team, bringing us to the only time our school won City Champs and qualifying for States. It also showed me that commitment and consistency goes a very long way.</p>
