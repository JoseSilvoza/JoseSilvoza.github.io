  <article>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been a team player, with a student-teacher mentalitiy I am able to use my abilities to my advantage and learn from my mistakes. I firmly believe in trusting the process and being able to maintain a positive mentality through uphill battles and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
    <p>Growing up as an inner-city kid and going to very diverse schools, always considered the <q>Underdogs</q>. One thing I realized throughout my time in public schools that stuck with me to this day is, <q>hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.</q> Being a student-athlete that not only inspired me in the classroom but it also translated onto the lacrosse field. It also showed me that commitment and consistency goes a very long way.</p>
