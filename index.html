   <!-- About Me -->
  <article>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My passion for web development stems from my love for computer games and tech. I grew up playing PC games and wanting to learn more on how certain platforms are built and designed but never got the chance to. I look forward to learning from others and developing new platforms/websites. I have always been a team player, with a student-teacher mentalitiy I am able to use my abilities to my advantage and learn from my mistakes.</p>
    <p>Other than my new addiction to web development, I am a sports junkie, with lacrosse being my main sport and soccer as my second. I have played organized lacrosse since middle school all the way through college.</p>
